### Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on key features: square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The dataset used for training the model contains historical data, where the house prices are the target variable, and the features (square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms) serve as predictors.

The model is trained to understand the linear relationships between these variables and predict the price of a house based on input values. Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling were applied to improve the model's performance. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

This project demonstrates the power of linear regression in real estate price prediction and can be expanded with additional features or more advanced regression techniques for further improvements.
